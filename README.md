## Abstract

GenBooth Idea Lab is an experimental platform investigating multi-agent system (MAS) architectures for educational contexts. The system employs an orchestrator-based agent coordination model with specialized domain assistants, exploring patterns in agent workflow composition, provider abstraction, and human-agent collaboration interfaces. Current research directions include agentflow design, cross-provider tool-calling parity, and persistent memory integration for learning contexts.

## System Overview

### Architecture

**Multi-Agent System (MAS) Components:**
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Central coordinator managing task delegation, context synthesis, and multi-agent conversations
- **Domain Agents**: Specialized assistants for Design, Software Engineering, and Science-Technology-Society modules
- **Provider Abstraction Layer**: Unified interface across Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, and Ollama with tool-calling normalization
- **Shared Memory**: RAG-based knowledge persistence and context grounding across agent interactions

**Micro-Application Suite:**
- **Idea Lab**: Academic module exploration with orchestrated multi-agent assistance
- **Image Booth**: AI-powered visual transformation workflows
- **Archiva**: Documentation and artifact management system
- **Planner**: Graph-based goal and dependency modeling
- **Workflows**: Reusable agent interaction patterns and guided procedures

### Technical Stack

```
Frontend:   React 19, Vite 5, Zustand (state management)
Backend:    Express 4 (ESM), JWT authentication
AI Layer:   Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, Ollama (local inference)
Integrations: Google OAuth, GitHub, Notion, Figma APIs
Deployment: Vercel, Docker, Google Cloud Run
Observability: Prometheus metrics, Winston logging
```

## Research Areas

### 1. Agent Orchestration & Coordination

Investigating orchestrator patterns for multi-agent collaboration:
- Task decomposition and delegation strategies
- Context handoff between specialized agents
- Agent personality modeling for domain expertise
- Conversation state management across agent switches

### 2. Agentflow Design Patterns

Exploring reusable workflow templates for agent interactions:
- Prompt chains with agent routing
- Interactive multi-step processes
- Structured guidance with completion artifacts
- Workflow-to-graph integration (linking Planner nodes to workflow steps)

### 3. Provider Abstraction & Tool Parity

Normalizing capabilities across heterogeneous AI providers:
- Unified chat interface with streaming support
- Tool-calling standardization (function schemas, execution patterns)
- Graceful degradation and fallback strategies
- Local vs. cloud model tradeoffs

### 4. Educational Context Integration

Applying MAS architecture to academic learning scenarios:
- Semester-structured module system (CODE University curriculum)
- Learning objective alignment with agent capabilities
- Project-based learning workflow support
- Cross-disciplinary knowledge synthesis
