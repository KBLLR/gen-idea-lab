    "summary_of_progress": "## 1. Summary of Progress\n- **What I worked on:**\n  - Implemented the update logic for the User Profile form (React component).\n  - Integrated the `PUT /api/users/{id}` endpoint for profile data submission.\n  - Added basic client-side validation for email and required fields using `Formik` and `Yup`.\n  - Set up Redux Thunk for asynchronous API calls and state management of user data (`profileSlice.js`).\n- **Time spent:** 4 h 15 m",
    "iteration_notes": "## 2. Iteration Notes\n- **Changes made:**\n  - **From local state to Redux:** Initially, the profile form state was managed entirely within the component using `useState`. This was refactored to use Redux slices (`profileSlice.js`) for storing current user data and managing its update lifecycle (loading, success, error states). This provides a single source of truth and simplifies prop drilling.\n  - **API request structure:** Modified the payload sent to the `PUT` endpoint to align with the backend's expected Data Transfer Object (DTO), specifically flattening nested objects (e.g., `user.address.street` became `street`) for better direct mapping.\n  - **Error handling:** Introduced global error handling middleware in Redux for API failures, displaying user-friendly messages via a custom toast notification system.\n\n- **Why:**\n  - **Lessons learned from last version:** Managing complex form states with local `useState` became cumbersome, especially with async operations and the need to share user data across multiple components. Redux provides a more predictable and scalable solution, especially with features like optimistic updates or re-fetching.\n  - **Feedback or data insights:** Peer code review highlighted the potential for 'prop drilling' and difficulty in debugging state changes without a centralized store. Centralized, consistent error handling across the application was also a key recommendation.\n\njavascript\n// Old approach (simplified - local state update logic)\nconst handleSubmit = async (values) => {\n  setLoading(true);\n  try {\n    await apiClient.put(`/users/${userId}`, values);\n    alert('Profile updated successfully!');\n  } catch (error) {\n    setError(error.message);\n  } finally {\n    setLoading(false);\n  }\n};\n\n// New approach (simplified - Redux dispatch logic)\nconst handleSubmit = (values, { setSubmitting }) => {\n  dispatch(updateUserProfile({ userId, profileData: values }))\n    .unwrap()\n    .then(() => showToast('Profile updated!', 'success'))\n    .catch((error) => showToast(`Error: ${error.message}`, 'error'))\n    .finally(() => setSubmitting(false));\n};\n",
    "critique_feedback": "## 3. Critique & Feedback\n- **External feedback:**\n  - **Lead Developer (Code Review):** \"Good progress on the Redux integration. Ensure all API error responses are properly mapped to user-facing messages, not just generic alerts. Consider adding optimistic updates for a smoother UX post-submission.\"\n  - **UX Designer (Usability Test):** \"The 'Save' and 'Cancel' buttons on the profile page are inconsistently styled compared to other forms across the application. Also, the success message should be a subtle toast notification, not a disruptive browser alert.\"\n- **Self-critique:**\n  - **What worked well:** The transition to Redux was smoother than anticipated, and the API integration logic feels robust after addressing initial CORS issues. Successfully handled several edge cases during local testing regarding form validation and data persistence.\n  - **What needs improvement:** UI consistency is still an issue; I need to dedicate time to align all form components with the design system. Error message specificity and user feedback (loading states, dynamic toasts) need significant improvement to enhance the overall user experience.",
    "blockers_challenges": "## 4. Blockers & Challenges\n- **Issues encountered:**\n  - **CORS Policy Error:** Encountered a `CORS policy` error when attempting to submit data from my local `Vite` development server (running on `localhost:5173`) to the local backend API (running on `localhost:8080`). This prevented any `PUT` requests from succeeding initially.\n  - **Redux Thunk Race Condition:** Discovered a subtle race condition where submitting multiple rapid updates (e.g., clicking 'Save' multiple times quickly) could lead to an outdated state being displayed or partially updated due to async dispatches not being properly ordered or cancelled.\n\n- **Mitigations & Next Steps:**\n  - **CORS Mitigation:** Configured `vite.config.js` to proxy `/api` requests to the local backend server, effectively bypassing the CORS issue during development. This is a common approach for local development setups.\n    javascript\n    // vite.config.js\n    import { defineConfig } from 'vite';\n    import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';\n\n    export default defineConfig({\n      plugins: [react()],\n      server: {\n        proxy: {\n          '/api': {\n            target: 'http://localhost:8080', // Your backend API target\n            changeOrigin: true, // Needed for virtual hosted sites\n            rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\\/api/, '') // Remove /api prefix from request path\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    });\n    \n  - **Race Condition:** Implemented a simple `isUpdating` flag in the Redux slice to disable the 'Save' button and prevent multiple submissions while an update is in progress. For a more robust solution, will explore using `AbortController` with `fetch` within `createAsyncThunk` or integrating a Redux Saga for advanced cancellation logic.",
    "action_items_next_steps": "## 5. Action Items / Next Steps\n- [ ] **Implement consistent button styling** for 'Save' and 'Cancel' actions on the profile page, adhering strictly to the established design system guidelines.\n- [ ] **Replace `alert()` with toast notifications** for success and error messages, ensuring a non-intrusive and visually appealing user experience.\n- [ ] **Add loading indicators and empty states** for the profile data display to improve perceived performance and provide better clarity to the user during data fetching.\n- [ ] **Write comprehensive unit tests** for `profileSlice.js` (reducers, selectors, thunks) and the `UserProfileForm` React component to ensure reliability.\n- [ ] **Schedule a quick sync with the backend team** to clarify expected API error response formats for more granular and user-friendly client-side error handling.",
