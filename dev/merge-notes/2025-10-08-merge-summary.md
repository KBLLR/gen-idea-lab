# Merge Summary (2025-10-08)

Merged. I used the terminal to fast-forward and merge the feature work into main.

## What I did
•  Merged feat/platform/modular-oauth into main
  ◦  Calendar header action bar (icon-only) with toggle for the third column
  ◦  Calendar modals switched to DS ModalWizard overlay
  ◦  Calendar spacing polish (removed blue background; added gutters; centered grid; consistent card theming)
  ◦  GestureLab drawing canvas DPR scaling and coordinate fixes (crisp strokes; aligned overlays)
  ◦  Added OAuth modular scaffolding files that were included in the feature branch (no behavior change if unused)
•  Pushed main to origin

## Current branches
•  main now includes all changes and is pushed: 2d25249 on origin/main
•  Feature branches remain in case you want to delete them later:
  ◦  feat/platform/modular-oauth (merged)
  ◦  feat/platform/oauth-modular-system (superseded; it was equal to main before merge)

If you want, I can delete the merged branch(es) locally and on origin to clean up.
