- **Pattern**: Consistent JSDoc annotations with @param, @returns, @typedef for all public APIs

2025-10-16: Fixed CORS errors blocking Vite dev server requests
- **Issue**: Server rejecting requests from `http://localhost:5173` with "CORS not allowed" errors
- **Root cause**: Vite running on default port 5173, but CORS only allowed ports 3000
- **Fix**: Added `http://localhost:5173` and `http://127.0.0.1:5173` to allowed origins in `server/index.js:43-44`
- **Result**: Vite dev server can now communicate with backend API without CORS errors

2025-10-16: Fixed Material Symbols ligature issue in headings (refined fix)
- **Issue**: User wanted to keep Material Symbols Outlined font for headings but without automatic icon conversion
- **Previous fix**: Removed Material Symbols entirely, but user wanted to keep the font
- **New fix**: Re-added 'Material Symbols Outlined' to h1-h6 but disabled ligatures with `font-feature-settings: 'liga' 0`
- **Result**:
  - ✅ Titles now use Material Symbols Outlined font style for text
  - ✅ No automatic icon conversion (ligatures disabled)
  - ✅ Icons still work correctly via `.icon` class
  - ✅ User gets desired font without icon transformation

2025-10-16: Fixed Settings modal infinite loop regression
- **Issue**: Settings modal causing infinite render loop (reported: "settings still going on loop!")
- **Root cause**: `WorkflowAutoTitleModelSelector` useEffect at line 878 depended on `workflowAutoTitleModel` but also called `setWorkflowAutoTitleModel`, creating circular dependency
- **Fix**: Removed `workflowAutoTitleModel` from dependency array, keeping only derived `currentModel` check
- **Changed**: `[loading, textModels, currentModel, workflowAutoTitleModel, setWorkflowAutoTitleModel]` → `[loading, textModels, currentModel, setWorkflowAutoTitleModel]`
- **Result**: Settings modal no longer triggers infinite re-renders

2025-10-16: Fixed icon font bleeding into regular text titles (initial attempt)
- **Issue**: Titles containing icon names (e.g., "description", "notebook", "code") were rendering as Material Icons instead of text
- **Example**: "Code Notebook" was displaying as icons instead of text
- **Root cause**: ALL headings (h1-h6) had `font-family: 'Material Symbols Outlined'` as the primary font, which enabled icon ligatures in title text
- **Initial fix**: Removed 'Material Symbols Outlined' from the h1-h6 font-family stack, keeping only 'Google Sans Display', sans-serif
- **Note**: This fix was superseded by refined fix above after user feedback

  - User-friendly toast notifications replace raw alerts
  - Better debugging with contextual error messages
- **Next**: Continue migrating remaining 33+ component files

2025-10-16: Fixed CommandPalette infinite render loop (final)
- **Performance issue**: CommandPalette was re-rendering infinitely even when closed
- **Root causes identified**:
  1. `commands` array recreated every render (depends on store value `isLiveVoiceChatOpen`)
  2. Actions retrieved via `useStore.use.actions()` which creates new object each render
  3. Unnecessary store subscriptions to unused values (`activeApp`, `activeModuleId`)
  4. Function dependencies in useMemo causing unnecessary recomputations
- **Comprehensive fixes**:
  - Changed action retrieval to stable selectors: `useStore(state => state.actions.actionName)`
  - Removed unused store subscriptions (activeApp, activeModuleId)
  - Wrapped `commands` in `useMemo` with minimal dependencies (only `isLiveVoiceChatOpen`)
  - Wrapped `filteredCommands` in `useMemo` with dependencies (commands, query)
  - Wrapped `executeCommand` in `useCallback` with dependency (onClose)
  - Optimized useEffects to only run when palette is actually open
  - Removed stable functions from useMemo dependencies (setActiveApp, navigate, etc.)
- **Result**: CommandPalette now only re-renders when `isOpen`, `query`, or `isLiveVoiceChatOpen` actually change

2025-10-16: Fixed missing testServiceConnection action and import error
- **Store actions**: Added `testServiceConnection` to actions proxy in store.js (line 376)

  - Shows "Testing..." state while connection test is in progress
  - Success toast on successful connection test
  - Error toast and inline error message on failure
  - Disables button during test to prevent multiple clicks
- **Error handler fix**: Changed import from named to default export (`import useStore from './store.js'`)
- **User experience**: Users can now test service connections from Settings modal with clear feedback

2025-10-16: Migrated Calendar AI from localStorage to Zustand persist middleware

2025-10-12: Service connection fixes with proper OAuth redirects and error handling
- **OAuth redirect fix**: Changed callback redirect parameter from `service` to `connected` to match Dashboard expectations
- **Error handling**: Added comprehensive error toast notifications for OAuth failures (oauth_error, missing_params, invalid_state, token_exchange, callback_error)
- **Service name formatting**: Improved service name display formatting (e.g., googleDrive → Google Drive) in toast messages
- **Error parameter**: Changed error redirects to use `errorService` parameter to avoid conflicts with success flow
- **User feedback**: All connection errors now show user-friendly toast messages with 7-second duration for better visibility
- **Toast z-index fix**: Increased toast container z-index to 999999 to ensure toasts appear above all UI elements
- **Real-time status updates**: Dashboard now calls fetchConnectedServices() after OAuth success to immediately refresh ServiceStatusWidget and AppCard states
- **Reactive UI**: All service-dependent components (ServiceStatusWidget, AppCard) automatically update when connection state changes via Zustand reactivity

2025-10-12: Production-ready Dashboard with app launcher, service status, and toast notifications
- **Dashboard home page**: Complete production-ready Dashboard at root `/` with personalized greeting, app launcher grid, category filtering, and service overview sidebar

- **Responsive design**: Two-column layout (app grid + sidebar) with mobile breakpoints; category filter buttons; quick stats showing app counts; quick links to common actions
- **Glassmorphism styles**: 800+ lines of production-ready CSS using design system tokens (--space-*, --color-*, --radius-*) with backdrop-filter, smooth transitions, hover effects, and accessibility features

2025-10-11: CharacterLab Google Drive import with real-time optimization progress
- **Drive import endpoint**: `/api/drive/models` lists GLB files from specific folder (16MZ6twRIR6-wFcHmy8ZdU8Fikk5X9D5J); `/api/drive/import/:fileId` downloads and optimizes with Server-Sent Events progress streaming
- **Enhanced optimization**: 11-step gltf-transform pipeline (dedup, instance, palette, flatten, join, weld, simplify with meshoptimizer, resample, prune, sparse, textureCompress to WebP) achieves 70-90% size reduction
- **Real-time progress**: SSE streams each optimization step to client with step name, description, progress percentage, and timing metrics
- **OAuth integration**: Uses existing Google Drive connection from getUserConnections for secure API access
- **Temporary staging**: Downloads to temp/drive-imports/, optimizes, then moves to permanent storage in server/storage/models/
- **Added meshoptimizer**: Installed meshoptimizer@0.25.0 for advanced mesh simplification in optimization pipeline

2025-10-11: CharacterLab Gallery with local storage, Google Model Viewer, optimized GLB hosting
- **Local-first storage**: Models stored in `server/storage/models/` after gltf-transform optimization (70-90% size reduction solves Google Drive "too big" issue)
- **Gallery in right pane**: Toggleable gallery view following micro-app column pattern; vertical list with 3D previews, download, and delete actions
- **Backend gallery endpoints**: `/api/rigging/gallery` (list), `/api/rigging/models/:filename` (serve with caching), `DELETE /api/rigging/gallery/:taskId`
- **Reusable ModelViewer component**: `ModelViewer.jsx` wraps `@google/model-viewer` web component with React props, auto-rotate, camera controls, AR support, loading states
- **Persistent storage**: Optimized GLBs moved from temp to permanent storage with metadata (original size, optimized size, savings percent)
- **Gallery toggle button**: Added to CharacterLabHeader action bar to show/hide gallery in right column

2025-10-11: CharacterLab Google Model Viewer integration, Zustand state management, GLB optimization
- 3D Viewer: Integrated @google/model-viewer (installed with --legacy-peer-deps due to Three.js peer dependency) for interactive 3D preview of rigged characters with auto-rotate, camera controls, and AR support.
- React wrapper: Created ModelViewer.jsx component wrapping model-viewer web component with React-friendly props, loading states, error handling, and animation support.
- State management: Created riggingTasksSlice.js with complete task lifecycle management (add, update, remove, polling, submit); integrated into global store.js for app-wide task state.
- Task polling: Implemented automatic 5-second polling for pending/in-progress tasks; starts on first submission, stops when all tasks complete or component unmounts.
- Sidebar interactivity: Tasks are now clickable to preview in 3D viewer; added Download FBX, View in 3D, and Remove task buttons with proper event handling.
- Visual feedback: Added .selected state to task cards with accent border and highlight; added rotating animation for in-progress status icons; error states with red styling.
- Backend optimization: Enhanced /api/rigging/download-glb endpoint to check for cached optimized GLB, apply gltf-transform optimization pipeline (50-80% size reduction), and gracefully fallback to original on failure.
- Header actions: Wired Refresh Tasks button to pollAllTasks() for manual task status updates; New Upload scrolls to upload zone.
- CSS enhancements: Added model-viewer-container styles, rotating keyframe animation, error state styling, task-action-remove danger hover state, and responsive model info bar.

2025-10-11: CharacterLab micro-app for 3D character rigging with Meshy AI API
- New micro-app: Created CharacterLab following the _template pattern with index.jsx, CharacterLab.jsx (main component), CharacterLabSidebar.jsx (rigging queue), character-lab.css (design system tokens), and CharacterLab.stories.jsx for Storybook.
- Backend integration: Added /api/rigging routes (submit, status, tasks, webhook, download) in server/routes/rigging.js; mounted in apiRouter.js; implemented secure proxy pattern to protect MESHY_API_KEY.
- File upload: Integrated multer for .glb file uploads with 100MB limit; converts to base64 for Meshy API submission.
- Routing: Registered characterlab routes in main.jsx with lazy loading; added to APP_ID_TO_SLUG and APP_ROUTE_MAP in routes.js.
- Navigation: Added CharacterLab to AppSwitcher.jsx, appHomeContent.js (with icon, title, description, tips), and prefetch.js for bundle preloading.
- Environment: Added MESHY_API_KEY configuration to .env.example with test mode key documentation; installed multer dependency.
- UI features: Drag-and-drop upload zone, character height configuration, task status tracking, progress indicators, download actions for completed rigs.

2025-10-11: GestureLab canvas fill, gestures, mirrored overlay, example toggles
- Whiteboard layout: Drawing canvas now fills the available space in the middle column; controls moved into the Panel footer (palette, brush sizes, eraser, save/upload/gallery).
- Gesture drawing: Implemented normalized pinch detection for consistent drawing across sizes; stabilized stroke continuity using a ref; eraser buttons switch to eraser mode (Open Palm) and pinch erases.
- Tracking resilience: Initialize on loadedmetadata; skip frames until video has real dimensions; guard/catch transient MediaPipe ROI errors and clear once tracking resumes.
- Overlay parity: Mirrored the hand landmarks overlay (whiteboard and 3D) to match the user’s perspective; ensured overlay is non-interactive above the canvas.
- Examples restored: Sidebar example toggles now single-select and switch modes (Whiteboard, 3D Navigation, UI Control) with sensible fallback to Whiteboard.
- Hook order fix: Consolidated Zustand actions selection to a single hook to prevent React Fast Refresh hook-order warnings.
- Layout wrapper: GestureLab app container updated to full-height flex column to ensure the panel occupies the entire middle column.

2025-10-08: Sidebar template adoption (ImageBooth, Workflows), ActionBar icon-only with separators, Settings z-index fix, workflow auto-title model, icon rendering fixes
- Apps: ImageBooth (VizGenBooth) moved ModeSelector to left pane via useLeftPane; center shows BoothViewer; ensured cleanup on unmount.
- Apps: Workflows moved WorkflowsList to left pane; center shows WorkflowEditor; removed right pane usage; ensured cleanup on unmount.
- Design System: ActionBar now defaults to icon-only and supports separators between icons; preserved accessibility via aria-label/title; updated SidebarSubheader and GlassDockToolbar to use separators.
- Settings: fixed modal vs app-switch overlay layering by setting .settings-overlay z-index to 1100 and .appswitch-overlay to 900.
- Store: added setWorkflowAutoTitleModel action and exposed it via actions proxy; resolved SettingsModal "setWorkflowAutoTitleModel is not a function" error.
- Validation: confirmed SettingsModal mounts once in App with Suspense and opens via actions.openSettings.
- Icons: fixed cases where Material icon names rendered as text — added conditional 'icon' font class to Button, SidebarItemCard, StatCard, ActionBar, BoothHeader, and SidebarSubheader; strengthened global .icon font settings (variation axes) while avoiding overriding emoji.

2025-10-08: DS ModalWizard, slot template, Chat slot refactor, alias hardening, onboarding, voice/assistant shims
- Design System: added ModalWizard organism with focus trap, ESC/overlay close, overlay click to close, pagination dots; exported from @ui; added story at design-system/organisms/ModalWizard/ModalWizard.stories.jsx.
- DS ActionBar hygiene: strip non-DOM props (e.g., showDividers) before spreading; accept ariaLabel but render aria-label; stable item keys (id || key || index fallback).
- Alias hardening: Vite resolve.alias moved to absolute FS paths using fileURLToPath+URL; Storybook aliases mirrored; @ui and @shared resolve reliably in dev and Storybook.
- Shims: added @shared/lib/modules.js (re-exports @apps/ideaLab/lib/modules.js) to fix Planner imports; added @shared/lib/assistant/tools.js to satisfy dynamic import in voiceFunctionManager; ensured HumeTest uses top-level @ui exports (no deep @ui/* paths).
- App slots: Chat converted to slot composition — left pane = AssistantsBar via useLeftPane; right pane = TabbedRightPane (Gallery | Notes); center = ChatHeader + ModuleAgentsChat. Removed inline sidebars.
- Micro-app template: scaffolded src/apps/_template with index.jsx, components/_TemplateSidebar.jsx, components/_Template.jsx, styles/_template.css and story for quick previews.
- Onboarding: replaced old WelcomeScreen with @ui ModalWizard; added settings.dismissedOnboarding in store (persisted); wired into App.jsx; respects ESC and overlay close.
- App Switcher overlay: updated copy to “Loading {App}…” and show last two log lines; ready for fade-in/fade-out polish.
- Planner: fixed @shared/lib/modules.js resolution (shim) to unblock @shared imports in PlannerCanvas.
- General hygiene: guarded dev logs behind __DEV__; fixed key warnings in EmpathyLab StatsRow and CalendarAI mini-calendar days; standardized ARIA casing; filtered prop leakage in SidebarToggleItemCard and ActionBar.

2025-10-07: Dev auth bypass, pane layout, store refactor, ActionBar cleanup, COOP headers
- Dev-only auth bypass: added .env.development.local with VITE_AUTH_BYPASS=1 and AUTH_BYPASS=1. Client seeds a dev user and skips the login gate when VITE_AUTH_BYPASS=1. Server requireAuth/optionalAuth short-circuit when AUTH_BYPASS=1 and inject a dev user.
- Pane providers and conditional layout: wrapped app with LeftPaneProvider and RightPaneProvider. Render left/right columns only when pane content exists. Added useLeftPaneNode/useRightPaneNode hooks to detect pane presence safely.
- App-owned sidebars: moved sidebars to their corresponding apps via useLeftPane. CalendarAI (CalendarAISidebar), GestureLab (GestureLabSidebar), EmpathyLab (EmpathyLabSidebar), Archiva (ArchivaSidebar), Planner (PlannerSidebar). Chat and Workflows use the right pane.
- Store refactor: lifted createAuthSlice, createServiceConnectionSlice, and createAppSwitchingSlice to top-level so per-key selectors (useStore.use.user, useStore.use.activeApp, etc.) are generated. Introduced actions proxy to preserve state.actions.* usage. Added setDockPosition/setDockDimensions and toggleKnowledgeSection/setShowKnowledgeSection.
- ActionBar normalization: standardized DS ActionBar API to items = [{ id, label, icon, onClick }]; fixed aria-label casing; removed unsupported showDividers prop; added stable keys for list items in ModuleViewer and related lists to resolve React key warnings.
- COOP/COEP dev headers: ensured Vite dev server and Storybook add headers Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin-allow-popups and Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: unsafe-none to avoid noisy postMessage warnings and keep OAuth popups working.
2025-10-06: DS + Orchestrator + Server inversion
- Orchestrator → Tasks ingestion: added normalizeTask, upsertTasksFromAgent, extractTasksFromMarkdown; added ingestPlanAsTasks(plan) and exported storeApi; Kanban can now ingest agent plans and docs.
- Design System primitives: implemented ActionBar, SidebarItemCard, StatCard with polymorphic ref-forward, tokens-only CSS, and stories; added icon-only variant to ActionBar; migrated key callsites to @ui.
- Storybook visual tests: added Playwright snapshots for Button, Panel, ActionBar, SidebarItemCard, StatCard.
- CalendarAI: countdown now rendered via DS ActionBar using children for stability.
- Server flip: centralized boot at server/index.js (calls startServer from server.js).
- Server imports: pointed server.js to src/shared/lib/{logger,secureTokens,metrics,auth,liveApiProxy,db}.
- Chat routes extracted to server/routes/chat.js and mounted under /api.
- Additional server modularization: extracted models (GET /api/models, GET /api/ollama/models), embeddings (POST /api/embeddings/ollama), tools (web search + ollama web_search/web_fetch/search + POST /api/search), module-chats (save/list), and planner (POST /api/planner/generate-from-context) into server/routes/* and mounted under /api.

2025-10-06: Micro-app slugs unified to lowercase (idealab, imagebooth, calendarai, empathylab, gesturelab, planner, archiva, workflows, chat). Router and server SPA fallbacks updated; added VITE_DEFAULT_APP env toggle for optional / → /idealab redirect this sprint while retaining legacy shell at /. Added route helpers via @routes (getAppPath/getAppIdFromPath) with a single APP_ID→slug map.

2025-10-06: Centralized Zustand store behind @store with persist + selector functions; left src/lib/store.js as a shim for one release cycle. Introduced Vite aliases: @ui (design system), @shared, @routes, @store, @apps. Began DS extraction: added src/design-system with tokens, utilities, and first batch shims (Button, ActionBar, SidebarItemCard, StatCard, Panel, ImageViewer, SidebarTooltip). Old UI paths remain for now; ESLint rule added to forbid new imports from src/components/ui.

2025-10-06: Server modularization: extracted auth, university, services, and image routes into separate files in `server/routes` directory. Created `server/config/env.js` for URL and environment helpers.

2025-10-05: GestureLab: theme-aware whiteboard + eraser mode. Whiteboard background follows theme (light/dark), hand overlay colors invert for contrast, and Fist gesture erases using destination-out compositing. Footer brush palette pins to bottom; canvas grows to fill remaining space.
2025-10-05: GestureLab: footer actions (Save, Upload, Gallery) added using user-actions styling. Save downloads PNG and stores to an in-memory gallery; Upload sets a background image (contained) under strokes; Gallery shows saved thumbnails with download and set-as-background options.
2025-10-05: GestureLab: added Eraser control with three sizes (8/12/20). Selecting an eraser size activates erase mode (Fist) and uses destination-out compositing for clean removal. Footer actions aligned to the right; palette and brush/eraser controls on the left.
2025-10-05: GestureLab Sidebar: removed redundant “Supported Gestures” panel (controls exist in header); moved example descriptions into About; changed Examples to toggle-row design consistent with EmpathyLab’s sidebar (reusing SidebarToggleItemCard).
2025-10-05: GestureLab 3D Stellar: integrated Three.js scene with star core, dust field, aura sprite, dynamic flare lines, and post-processing (bloom + afterimage). Added pulse() and rotate(dx, dy) APIs and wired fist → pulse and two-hands → rotate. Sidebar “Examples” now controls mode (Whiteboard vs 3D Navigation) exclusively.
2025-10-05: GestureLab 3D overlay: render hand landmarks above the Stellar scene (red theme), fixed sizing when whiteboard canvas isn’t present, and relaxed loop guard to allow overlay-only rendering in 3D.
2025-10-05: GestureLab UI Control: added interactive UI canvas with tiles (Wi‑Fi/Lights/Music) and a volume slider. Mirrored pointer aligned to landmarks; pinch to toggle tiles or set volume. Implemented ref-based hover/press/bounce states with springy animations for tiles and knob. Fixed draw guard to avoid errors when non-whiteboard modes are active.
2025-10-05: Module Assistant Chat: added model selector (Gemini + service-aware models for Ollama/OpenAI/Claude) and per‑module system prompt editor. sendAssistantMessage now uses selected model + override prompt. Added Save button to persist current chat in module profile.

2025-10-05: EmpathyLab layout restructure: removed middle AllEmotionsList column for 2-panel layout (camera + chat) with more space; added EmotionsFooter component showing top 10 active emotions as horizontal scrollable chips with icons, colors, and percentage scores; each panel now has dedicated footer (camera: StatsRow stats, chat: EmotionsFooter with emotion chips).

2025-10-05: Redesigned HumeVoiceChat to match empathic-ai UI pattern: scrollable messages with emotion cards (top 3 emotions as colored progress bars at bottom of each message), floating controls bar at bottom with gradient fade, MicFFT audio visualization (24-bar SVG using real FFT data from Hume), mute toggle button, cleaner layout with auto-scroll on new messages; emotion cards use Hume's official color palette and show emotion name + percentage + animated progress bar.

2025-10-05: EmpathyLab enhancements: added AllEmotionsList component displaying all 52 Hume emotions with real-time sorting (active emotions at top), emotion-specific icons and colors from Hume's official color palette, circular color indicators, scrollable list with overflow handling; integrated sci-fi GazeOverlay (animated SVG with pulsing focus point, direction line, strength display) and EmotionFusionDisplay (multimodal analysis with conflict detection, valence/arousal metrics); added comprehensive sidebar visualization controls (9 overlay toggles including face mesh, gaze, body/hand skeletons, advanced overlays); fixed real-time overlay toggling via useRef pattern in useHumanWebcam hook; fixed loading state stuck on stop; added extensive Hume debug logging for connection troubleshooting; fixed 3-panel grid layout overflow by adding proper flex constraints to Panels (min-height: 0, overflow-y: auto on .image-content) ensuring emotion analysis column is scrollable and stats bar always visible as footer.

2025-10-03: Added reusable ImageViewer (image/camera modes) and useHumanWebcam hook with requestVideoFrameCallback fallback and device picker support; integrated EmpathyLab to use the hook (clean start/stop, smoother loop, selectable camera) and replaced VideoFrame usage to centralize canvas/video rendering; added Storybook stories for ImageViewer (image, camera placeholder, canvas overlay mock).

2025-10-03: Added WebcamStream component docs and stories; created Empathy/StatsRow story. WebcamStream wraps useHumanWebcam for a self-contained camera + overlay experience and is intended for EmpathyLab and related apps.
